# Online-Voting-System
The "Computer Voting System using C++" project is a mini voting system that enables administrators to manage voters, set up the voting process, and view results. It utilizes text files for data storage and includes classes for file handling. The project allows voters to cast their votes and prevents duplicate voting.
